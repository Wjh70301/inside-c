    <h1>The Secret Life of C++: Day 2: Run Time Type Information</h1>

    Run time type information allows us to do complicated things at
    runtime, like dynamic_cast<>.
    <p>
    As we saw in our VTable examples, there is a pointer to a type
    info structure in every vtable of every class. This allows us to
    look at this object at runtime and find out details about the
    class we have. All we have to know is the vtable for an object,
    and we can, for example, find the name of its type.
    <p>
    Lets look at a quick example that use dynamic_cast<>.
    <a href="dynamic-cast.cc">dynamic-cast.cc</a>,
    <a href="dynamic-cast.s">dynamic-cast.s</a>,
    <a href="dynamic-cast.listing">dynamic-cast.listing</a>.
    <p>
    Its clear that the __dynamic_cast method does all of the work.
    Lets see what its implementation looks like:
    <a href="__dynamic_cast.cc">__dynamic_cast.cc</a>
