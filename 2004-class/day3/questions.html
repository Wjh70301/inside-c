    <h1>The Secret Life of C++: Day 3: Questions from last session</h1>

    Lets answer some questions from last session:

    <h2>What does _Unwind_Resume do?</h2>

    This we will cover in <a href="exceptions.html">Exceptions</a> today.

    <h2>If you pass something const, why copy?</h2>

    Because if you didn't mean to copy, then you would have passed a
    const reference to the object.

    <h2>Can't you get away without the return value pointer by looking
    up the stack and expecting it to be there?</h2>

    I don't have a solid answer for this one, but one thought I had is
    cases where you only want to move the stack pointer once in a
    function body, but you want to call many different functions with
    return values on the stack, so you want to be able to tell them
    more complicated places for it than just right at the bottom of
    the stack.
