    <h1>The Secret Life of C++: Symbol Mangling</h1>

    Symbol mangling is done by C++ because the linker only supports a
    global namespace. Basically, mangling is a lot like what C
    programmer do by hand when they name their functions things like
    libfoo_getobjattr(). Except that the C++ mangling is done
    automatically, and so it has to really be unique.

    <p>
    Mangled names always start with <code>_Z</code>. Following this is
    the mangled name of either a function and its type, an object
    name, or a "special name".

    <p>

    There are a number of attributes that will be included in the
    mangled name of a function:

    <dl>
    <dt>

    </dl>
