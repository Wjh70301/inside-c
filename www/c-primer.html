    <h1>The Not So Secret Life of C</h1>

    <p>
      The idea of this class is to understand how C++ is translated
      into assembly (how assembly is translated into object code is
      left as an exercise for the student).

    <p>
      So first we will talk about how C is translated into assembly,
      because C++ is mostly a superset of C, and because it a good way
      to learn techniques for achieving this understanding.

    <h2>Hello World</h2>

    <p>
      First lets look at what hello world looks like in assembly.

      <div role="tabpanel">

        <!-- Nav tabs -->
        <ul class="nav nav-tabs" role="tablist">
          <li role="presentation" class="active"><a href="#hello-world-c" aria-controls="hello-world-c" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">C Code</a></li>
          <li role="presentation"><a href="#hello-world-s" aria-controls="hello-world-s" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">GCC Assembly</a></li>
          <li role="presentation"><a href="#hello-world-mac" aria-controls="hello-world-mac" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">Mac Assembly</a></li>
        </ul>

      <div class="tab-content">
        <div role="tab-panel" class="tab-pane active" id="hello-world-c">
          Our source code, as you might expect, looks like this (<a href="hello-world.c">click here for the source in a file.</a>):
          <pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main (int argc, char **argv) {
    printf("Hello World.\n");
    return 0;
}
          </code></pre>
        </div>
        <div role="tab-panel" class="tab-pane" id="hello-world-s">

      We turn that into assembly, and it looks like <a href="hello-world.s">hello-world.s</a>.
      <pre><code class="language-nasm">	.file	"hello-world.c"
	.version	"01.01"
gcc2_compiled.:
.section	.rodata
.LC0:
	.string	"Hello World.\n"
.text
	.align 4
.globl main
	.type	 main,@function
main:
	pushl %ebp
	movl %esp,%ebp
	subl $8,%esp
	addl $-12,%esp
	pushl $.LC0
	call printf
	addl $16,%esp
	xorl %eax,%eax
	jmp .L2
	.p2align 4,,7
.L2:
	leave
	ret
.Lfe1:
	.size	 main,.Lfe1-main
	.ident	"GCC: (GNU) 2.95.4 20011002 (Debian prerelease)"
      </pre></code>
        </div>
        <div role="tab-panel" class="tab-pane" id="hello-world-mac">
          Or on the mac:
          <pre><code class="language-nasm">Test`helloWorld() at main.cpp:12:
0x100000c80:  pushq  %rbp
0x100000c81:  movq   %rsp, %rbp
0x100000c84:  leaq   0x2b6(%rip), %rdi         ; "Hello, World"
0x100000c8b:  popq   %rbp
0x100000c8c:  jmp    0x100000ec0               ; symbol stub for: puts
          </pre></code>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      How do we do that? We run <code>cc -s -o hello-world.s hello-world.c</code> Or we set a breakpoint in XCode and check Debug -> Debug Workflow -> Always Show Assembly. Or we get the built objects and we run odump on them. If building with xocde they will be at /Users/tibbetts/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Test-gklyipaixaqhfmaztcrgfnmrvniq/Build/Intermediates/Test.build/Debug/Test.build/Objects-normal/x86_64

    <p>

    <p>
      We can also see it with source interpolated by running
      <code>cc -g -c -Wa,-adhls=hello-world.listing hello-world.c</code>
      The output of that will look like <a href="hello-world.listing">hello-world.listing</a>

    <h2>Some notes about memory</h2>

    In a running process there are 5 parts to memory:
    <dl>
    <dt>Text<dd>The area where the program code is found.
    <dt>Data<dd>Area where initialized global variables are loaded.
    <dt>BSS<dd>Area for uninitialized global variables, part of your free store.
    <dt>Heap<dd>Area where memory allocators get their memory.
    <dt>Stack<dd>Place were stack frames and local variables are allocated.
    </dl>

    <h2>Global Variable</h2>

    We can look at how global variables are defined in assembly. They
    are basically symbols which point into these memory areas and
    never change. Sometimes the are exposed to LD, sometimes not. See
    this <a href="global-variables.s">assembly</a> or this <a
    href="global-variables.listing">listing</a> based on <a
    href="global-variables.c">global-variables.c</a> for more detail.

    <h2>Functions</h2>

    Functions are chuncks of code that get called using the
    <code>call</code> instruction. The basic idea is that we jump into
    that location, run the code, and jump back to where we came from.
    <p>
    We use the stack to store where we came from, so that we can get
    back. But since the code we call might trash the registers, we
    also want to save some registers on the stack. And we need to pass
    arguments, so we put those on the stack too, unless if they don't
    fit in the registers.
    <p>
    We also pass return values back through a register,
    <code>eax</code> on Intel.

    <h2>Calling Convention</h2>

    Calling convention just means identifying which registers the
    caller saves, which registers the callee saves, where to put the
    arguments and where to put the return value.
    <p>
    The example <a href="function.c">function.c</a> (<a
    href="function.s">function.s</a>, <a
    href="function.listing">function.listing</a>)

    <h2>Control Structures</h2>

    Control structures such as if/else, while and do-while are all
    implemented in terms of conditional jumps in assembly. This is
    fairly straightforward. Check out <a
    href="if-then.c">if-then.c</a> (<a href="if-then.s">if-then.s</a>,
    <a href="if-then.listing">if-then.listing</a>) for a simple
    example.

    <h2>Pointers</h2>

    You may have noticed that assembly already deals with pointers a
    great deal. So its obvious how pointers and pointer arithmatic are
    dealt with when they are compiled.

    <h2>Array</h2>

    An array is just a pointer to the beginning of the array. To mess
    with a value to it, you just calculate the offset.

    <p>
    TODO: Write a short example.

    <h2>Structures</h2>

    Like arrays, structures are just going to be pointers to the start
    of a memory area. To access the contents, you just calculate the
    offset.
    <p>
    Since they are of a fixed size, you can put them on the stack easily enough.

    TODO: Write a short example.

    <h2>Unions</h2>

    And of course Unions are like structures, but with slightly more complex sorts of offsets.
    <p>
    TODO: Write a short example.

    <hr>

    That's it for our introduction to how C is compiled. As you can
    see, C is very simple to compile, asssuming you aren't doing any
    optimization.
